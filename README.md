# Github Token Scanner Test
This is a simple repo to test Github's new [token scanning](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-10-16-token-scanning-for-public-repositories/) tool.
I am starting by adding some slack tokens to see if they get disabled.

### Warning
This is stupid, never upload api keys to your github account.
